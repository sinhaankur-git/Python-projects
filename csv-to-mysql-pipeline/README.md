# 🧑‍💼 Employee Data Insertion Project

This project demonstrates how to use **Python (Pandas + MySQL)** to clean and insert structured employee data into a **MySQL database** from a CSV file. It's a great beginner-to-intermediate project for understanding how Python integrates with databases, and how real-world data is cleaned and prepared before loading.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

- 🔍 Read employee data from CSV using `pandas`
- 🛢️ Insert records into MySQL database table using `mysql.connector`
- 🧼 convert date formats
- ✅ Handle type conversion, formatting, and connection setup

## 🧪 Sample Schema (`employees` Table)

```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    emp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50),
    last_name VARCHAR(50),
    departments VARCHAR(100),
    positions VARCHAR(100),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    hire_date DATE,
    gender ENUM('M', 'F'),
    email VARCHAR(100),
    phone VARCHAR(15)
);
```
